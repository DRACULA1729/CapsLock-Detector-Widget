# CapsLock Detector Widget

## Description
CapsLock Detector Widget is a simple, lightweight application that provides a visual indicator for the Caps Lock key state. It creates a small, always-on-top window that displays whether Caps Lock is currently on or off.

## Features
- Real-time Caps Lock state detection
- Always-on-top window for easy visibility
- Color-coded indicator (red for ON, green for OFF)
- Lightweight and minimal resource usage

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- keyboard library

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
Run the script using Python:
(for basic design)
```python
python main.py
```
(for better design)
```python
python test.py
```

The widget will appear on your screen, staying on top of other windows. It will update in real-time as you toggle the Caps Lock key.
